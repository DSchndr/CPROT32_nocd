# CPROT32_nocd
NoCD Patch for Reinisch GmbH & Co. KG security handler

# Why?
Since new Notebooks come without CD drives, using Service manuals near the car requires you to drag around a CD drive dangling around on a USB cable - which is a high risk where you might damage the CD of your Oldtimer Service Manual.

For compatibility reasons, this Patch allows you to use the encrypted Service Manuals without a (built in) CD drive.

# How to apply?
Copy the contents of your CD into a folder on your harddrive (by using a stationary PC or by other means)

Import the "READ32/PLUG_INS/CPROT32.API" file into ImHex, then go to Import->IPL Patch and import the patch of this repository.

Hit save and replace the original file, done.

(BTW: run the acrobat reader in windows me compat mode...)
